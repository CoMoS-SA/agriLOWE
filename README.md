# agriLOWE
This repository contains all the features and code necessary to reproduce the agriLOWE ABM model. The model encompasses a spatial-based economy with an ecology of N farmers and 3 different types of land. Technological progress as well as shocks deriving from the interactions with the climate are modelled. The simulation aims at addressing these two open issues: is it possible to assess the climate change impacts to the agricultural sector in different technologically â€“ developed countries, utilizing a global model? Further, is low technological change in the agricultural sector a bottleneck for development and climate change mitigation?
