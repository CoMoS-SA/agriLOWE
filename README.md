# agriLOWE
This repository contains all the features and instructions necessary to reproduce the agriLOWE ABM model. The model encompasses a spatial-based economy with an ecology of N farmers and 3 different types of land. Technological progress as well as shocks deriving from the interactions with the climate are modelled. 

The simulation aims at addressing these two open issues: is it possible to assess the climate change impacts to the agricultural sector in different technologically â€“ developed countries, utilizing a global model? Further, is low technological change in the agricultural sector a bottleneck for development and climate change mitigation?

# Model's main components
1. Ecology of N farmers (no exit & no entry); 
2. 3 types of land: forestry, low-yield land (characterized by low fertility and intrinsic low productivity of the land) and high-yield land (where the fertility of the ground and the related productivity are instead higher);
3. Production = min {alphaL, gammaS, thetaK} with alpha=productivity of labour embodied in the machines;
                                                  gamma=productivity of land;
                                                  theta=productivity of capital; 
4. Each farmer produce an homogenous bundle of food and the market is perfectly competitive;
5. Demand is increasing at a fix rate over time: D=D(t-)(1+*d*)
6. Labour force is equally distributed among cells : l(t)=L/(xy-f) with f=forestry cells 
7. Cost structure is marginalist: C(it)= w/alpha + p_land/gamma
8. Technological progress depends on R&D internal and R&D external
9. Profit = ((p_food - UC(it))sales(it))) - R&Dint - R&Dext

# Climate Interactions

1. Damage function: Nordhaus (2017, Weitzman (2009)
2. Carbon uptake: Sterman et al. (2012) and IIASA's Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM)
